                <h2>What is Cardiac Arrest ?</h2>
                <p>Cardiac arrest is a sudden and life-threatening medical condition where the heart abruptly stops beating, leading to a loss of blood flow to the brain and other vital organs. It can occur without warning and requires immediate medical intervention. Unlike a heart attack, which is caused by a blockage in blood flow to the heart, cardiac arrest is an electrical malfunction in the heart that disrupts its pumping ability</p>

                    <h4>1. Sudden Loss of Responsiveness</h4>
                    <p>What to Look For:
                    The person is unconscious and does not respond to your voice, shouting, or physical stimulation like tapping their shoulders. <br>
                    What This Indicates:
                    The brain is not receiving oxygen-rich blood due to the heart stopping, leading to a loss of consciousness.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="grid-item">  
                    <h4>2. No Normal Breathing</h4>
                        <p>What to Look For:
                        Check if the person is breathing normally. In cardiac arrest:
                        Breathing may stop entirely.
                        The person may exhibit agonal breathing (gasping for air in an irregular manner). <br>
                         how to Check:
                        Place your ear close to the person's mouth and look at their chest for movement.
                        If breathing is absent or abnormal, it’s a critical sign of cardiac arrest.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="grid-item">  
                    <h4>3. No Pulse or Heartbeat</h4>
                        <p>  What to Look For:
                        Feel for a pulse on the person’s neck (carotid artery) or wrist (radial artery). <br>
                         What This Indicates:
                        A lack of pulse suggests the heart has stopped pumping blood. This is a definitive sign of cardiac arrest.
                        Note: If you're unsure how to check a pulse, prioritize CPR.</p>

                <div class="grid-item">  
                    <h4>   4. Sudden Collapse</h4>       
                        <p> What to Look For:
                        The person may suddenly fall to the ground or collapse without warning. <br>
                        What This Indicates:
                        The collapse happens because the brain and muscles no longer receive oxygen and nutrients, causing a sudden loss of function.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="grid-item">  
                    <h4>   5. Skin Changes</h4>
                        <p> What to Look For:
                        Pale, bluish (cyanotic), or gray skin color.
                        Cold, clammy skin due to poor circulation. <br>
                         What This Indicates:
                        The lack of blood flow and oxygen causes the body’s extremities and skin to change color and temperature.</p>

                <div class="grid-item">  
                    <h4> 6. Warning Signs Before Cardiac Arrest (Optional or Infrequent):</h4> 
                    <p> Some individuals may experience symptoms minutes or hours before the arrest:
                
                    Chest discomfort or pain (similar to a heart attack).
                    Dizziness, light-headedness, or fainting.
                    Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
                    Heart palpitations (feeling that the heart is beating irregularly or too fast).
                    While these symptoms can occur, cardiac arrest often strikes without warning</p>

                      <p>Place your hands, one on top of the other, in the center of the chest. Perform chest compressions by pushing down hard and fast (at least 2 inches deep at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute). Allow the chest to fully recoil between compressions.</p>

                        <p>If you are trained in CPR, give 2 rescue breaths after every 30 chest compressions. Tilt the person's head back, pinch their nose, and breathe into their mouth, ensuring the chest rises. If you are untrained, continue only with chest compressions (Hands-Only CPR).</p>

                        <p>If an AED is available, turn it on and follow the voice prompts. Attach the electrode pads to the person’s bare chest. The AED will analyze the heart rhythm and advise whether a shock is needed. If prompted, deliver a shock by pressing the button.</p>

                    <p> 
                        Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) is a life-threatening emergency that occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating. It strikes people of all ages who may seem to be healthy, even children and teens. When SCA happens, the person collapses and doesn’t respond or breathe normally. They may gasp or shake as if having a seizure. SCA leads to death in minutes if the person does not get help right away. Survival depends on people nearby calling 911, starting CPR¹, and using an AED² (if available) as soon as possible.
                        <ul>
                            <li>CPR: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is when you push hard and fast on the center of chest to make the heart pump. Compressions may be given with or without rescue breaths.</li>
                            <li>AED: Automated external defibrillator is a device that analyzes the heart and if it detects a problem may deliver a shock to restart the heart’s normal rhythm.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            No. While the average cardiac arrest victim is about 60-years-old, it affects people of all ages—even children and teens. Thousands of youth under the age of 18 experience Cardiact Arrest each year.

                            NO. Cardiact arrest is a electrical problem in the heart, Let us under stand the different between cardiact arrest and Heart attack,

                    <summary>WHAT is Ejection fraction (EF)  ?</summary>
                        <p>
                            Ejection fraction (EF) refers to how well the heart is pumping. It's the percentage of blood that is pumped out of the heart’s main pumping chamber during each heartbeat. If the EF is low (35% or lower), the person is at increased risk for sudden cardiac death. It is important to know that the EF can change over time.

                    <p>CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, involves pushing on the center of the chest (between the nipples) hard and fast (100-120 pumps per minute) to circulate oxygenated blood already in the body to the brain and other organs.</p>

                    <p>An AED, or automated external defibrillator, is a device that automatically analyzes heart rhythms and advises the operator to deliver a shock if the heart is in a fatal heart rhythm. It is designed for use by untrained bystanders. AEDs are safe and cannot hurt the victim.</p>

Research has shown some of the best locations for AED placement are in 24-hour coffee shops or near ATMs. Increasingly, consumers are choosing to purchase AEDs for their homes and vehicles, since most SCAs outside hospital settings occur in home settings.</P>
